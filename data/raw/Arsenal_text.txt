Arsenal are going to win the league now
bear with me for my rationale on this
please listen to what I have to say I've
been saying that Arsenal are going to
win the league since before a ball was
kicked this season and a lot of the time
I have been laughed at now look I
concede that my predictions sometimes go
a little bit of R famously go a little
bit of R but with this one I am just so
convinced that Arsenal have what it
takes I am gutted with these words I
don't want this to be the case I
desperately want Manchester City to win
the league but you must see something in
this Arsenal team that suggests that
they are capable of winning the league
they are behaving like Champions already
they are doing the things that title
winners do time and time and time again
they have the personality that suggests
they are winners they have a manager who
seems to have the right amount of spite
to suggest that they can be winners they
have the right amount of silk in the
squad to suggest that they can be
winners and they are fighting tooth and
nail for every point they have a Never
Say Die attitude that is relatively new
for this modern generation of Arsenal
Arsenal previously in the recent past
have had a quite a weak
underbelly there has been a
vulnerability to Arsenal but that isn't
the case anymore there is a drive a
determination and a will to win and a
Never Say Die attitude think about the
amount of points that they managed to
ACR in the latter stages of games so far
this season look at what happened at
kenor road yesterday look kennor road is
a very difficult place to go it is a
really tricky away ground and if you are
of the persuasion that Arsenal are not
going to win the league I think that you
would have pinpointed kennworth Road
under the lights in December as the type
of game where they could have
potentially dropped points it is a
tricky game L are good they were a very
good side they do certain things
perfectly they disrupt they make life
difficult for you they put their own
force on the game they are a throwback
to previous Premier League time times
from a bygone era and it really is the
kind of game that could have been tricky
for Arsenal simply because Luton don't
have the rasat Taz or the sparkle or The
Dazzle of the modern Premier League era
you know they don't have the the huge
Marquee signing or the or the Glamorous
name on the touchline people think that
they're that they're potentially easy to
beat or you should be beating them but
trust me going to Kenworth Road
particularly in the conditions that
Arsenal went there it's one of the most
difficult away games of the season and
Arsenal won did they deserve to win
probably not but that is another that is
another reason to suggest that they are
title winners winning games that you
don't deserve to win is the Hallmark of
title winners think about how many
things that they are doing that suggest
that they are title winners and let's
also remember
that you would have suggested that
Arsenal don't necessarily have the
resolve to win the league surely surely
that result is the answer like we've
seen it before we've seen it against
Manchester United we've seen them come
back against Chelsea we've seen it time
and time again actually with this
Arsenal team but if you were in doubt
that this Arsenal team have what it
takes to win the league surely the
nature of the game at kenor Road tells
you that they're going to be Champions
think about everything that happened
their goalkeeper had a m everything was
going wrong they were conceding goals
left right and Center it was intense it
was bitter it was cold it was everything
that Arsenal should have choked under
and what happened
Declan rice yet again like when Arsenal
signed Declan rice they knew they were
signing a worldclass player they knew
that they were signing somebody who was
capable of edging them to a different
Echelon but
even even they kind of dreamed that he
would be this good even West Ham fans
who fell in love with him last year on
that run in Europe can't have dreamed
that he would be this good because we
know that he can dictate the play we
know that he can he can guarantee the
tempo of a game we know know that he can
do certain things he can be a driving
force in Midfield we know that he good
at winning the ball we know he good at
recycling the ball we know he has a good
passing range but nobody could have
expected him to have this kind of impact
on a title race goal's Galore in the
last minute did it again to Manchester
United and when he did it against
Manchester United presumably even he
would have thought that would be the
biggest goal I scored this season surely
even he would have believed that a last
minute winner against Manchester United
in the context of garnacho and
everything else surely he would have
thought that would have been the the the
Zenith of his goalscoring prowess this
season luton's bigger the the timing is
more significant the nature of it counts
for more and he the fact that he has
done it again adds weight to who he is
as a player weirdly didn't think it was
his best game for Arsenal didn't think
he had a particularly good game you know
I thought ky's annoyingly played really
well um gabri Jus but but he came up
with such a moment such a decisive
moment and think about what it means
right Dean Rice's goal was the ninth
that Arsenal has scored in the 84th
minute or later in the League this
season they have scored nine goals
beyond the 84th
minute that's we're getting into a Fergy
time era here aren't we we're getting
into a Never Say Die attitude they're
always in a game and you could see the
celebrations afterwards you you saw the
away end go pop po y potty behind that
goal as Dean rice flick the header in
Wild they went the Arsenal fans went
potty I don't know if I've seen him go
like that for decades you know the
footage the famous footage of of Arsenal
winning the league at anfield in '89
have a look at the fans celebrating it's
not
dissimilar the significance of the
victory at kenor road is not dissimilar
I genuinely think that they know that
something is happening it's painful to
see and it's painful to talk about Mikel Arteta
saka
 went while he got banned by he got
he got booked he now going to miss he
can't be on the Dugout he can't be in
The Dugout for the game against Villa
like that is ridiculous it's his third
booking of the Season which means he
misses a game which is truly ridiculous
Banning him from the touch line for the
match against Villa on Saturday it
really doesn't make any sense um but
Arsenal are moving forward and you know
what they don't con see go really I know
they caned three against Lon but they do
have the best defense in the league and
I think that they can right off last
night particularly now they got the
victory as just one of those moments you
know just one of those bad everything
goes a little bit wrong it's not your
day at the back and you kind of get away
with it but was a bit of a throwback to
kind of early arteta you know just a
disarray at the back the only problem
the only negative thing to come out of
yesterday
was David ryer like David ryer is by far
not an upgrade on Aaron ramale he is not
definitely a better keep than and ramale
like that's not even a debate if you
believe that Ry is better than ramale
then cool that's fine you can believe
that and maybe you're correct I happen
to believe that ramale is better and
maybe I'm correct the fact that mikel Arteta
has upset the rhythm of his goalkeeper
the rhythm of the back line for a player
who is definitely not explicitly better
could be seen as being mistake on some
level I feel sorry for Arteta  you know
he tried to bring in a player he
tried to create competition he wants to
have two brilliant players per position
but this is causing a problem and after
a performance like that I mean Aaron
ramsdale stock has sort of grown and he
hasn't even kicked the ball you know
it's one of those weird things isn't it
like I think Aaron ramelle's Prestige
Aaron ramsdell's Case for being in the
team is now bigger than it was when he
was playing because we've watched we
have watched David reyer concede at
least I mean that Barkley one that went
under him was ridiculous the the one
where he came out for the header with
with those massive white why is his GL
so big doesn't make any sense but it's
it's all going a little bit wrong for R
I know he was all right against wolves
but I think they need to get on rounds
back but this is a painful video to
record on a Tuesday Wednesday morning
Arsenal are going to win the league we
have to just agest to that thank you so
much for watching this video if you have
enjoyed it please do me a favor please
give it a like please click subscribe
and I will see you all tonight as
Chelsea batter Man United
in 2024 Arsenal have 15 wins in 17 games
they've played 17 League games and they
have won 15 of them that is Elite that
is comparable to anything that anyone
has done in the Premier League era that
really is Sensational and something that
even amplifies that already impressive
record is the fact that of the two games
that didn't end in Victory one of them
was a draw at the EAD so in one of those
games where Arsenal didn't get the
victory they actually got what they
wanted to get out of the game you know
Arsenal went into that game they
desperately wanted a point they wanted
to take four points cumulatively over
Manchester City and they managed to get
what they wanted out of that game so the
reason that Arsenal are not top of the
league because their run this calendar
year has been devastating is because of
that one fixture against unai 's Aston
Villa but doesn't it show you the fine
margins and how difficult it is to win
the league and what we can glean from
this is that anyone who ever comes with
the hole Arsenal have choked Arsenal
have bottled it Arsenal are vulnerable
they have a weak underbelly if you
suggest that I'm afraid that you are
completely utterly mistaken it's a shame
I wish you were correct but this Arsenal
side have proven to us time and time
again that they are not vulnerable they
are not chokers that record is truly
Sensational and I think we could say
that maybe last season they did bottle
it you could suggest that they choked
there were various moments last season
the game against West Ham the game
against Liverpool there was a moment
last season when I genuinely believed
that arsenal were going to win the
league and that's because they went away
to anfield in a title running and
shooting towards the cop they found
themselves 2-0 up that is a statement
Victory and obviously they didn't win
that game you had the sacker penalty
then we will know what happened against
Southampton so if you want to say that
Arsenal bottled it last year I won't
take issue with that but this year they
are definitely not chokers they have
proven time and time again that that
weak underbelly that has played them for
a little while
has gone this season they've been
nothing but resilient whenever it goes
wrong for them they bounce back whenever
a question is asked of them they have a
resounding answer and that is the very
definition of being a champion and that
is why Arsenal will be Champions this
squad of players will be Champions
whether it's this season is up for
debate whether they actually manag to
find the in the armor of
Manchester City this season I don't know
time is running out Road is running out
the season is coming to an end when
Arsenal don't need it to they need more
games but this squad of players will be
Champions you look at the development
you look at what they have been doing
you look at the Improvement you look at
the age and you can see that this squad
is still learning still developing and
they have now won as many games as the
invincibles that's historic think about
how Arsenal fans talk about the
invincibles think about the the esteem
in which that invincible side are held
not only by Arsenal fans but in World
football in the pantheon of great clubs
that achievement is seen by some as
being one of the very best not
necessarily by me but is seen as being
one of the very best this Arsenal team
this young developing Arsenal team with
Mikel aeter in charge has won as many
games in a calendar in a
season as that Arsenal team and let's
face it Arsenal still have two games to
play I believe that Arsenal will win two
more games this season so they will
totally Blitz the the winning streak of
the invincibles out of the water they
will break it by two and if they do that
they will end this season with one less
Point than those invincibles that is
just unreal and think about how young
this team are think about the
development you know Arsenals game
still to come they're looking at
Manchester United and Everton I believe
that they will win those games that will
take them to 89 points they're going to
do it they're going to do it and think
about the think about the team that they
will be this time next year think about
the player that Dean rice is going to be
with this experience in the bag you know
he spoken about not being there last
year but he can feel that there is
something building something more
impressive and if you look at how they
were performing this time last year and
compare it to now you can just see the
development look at the Eevee with which
they won today and compare it to how
they got on against Bournemouth last
year okay fine they did beat Bournemouth
last year but they were relying on what
a 97th minute Rees Nelson winner in
order to get the three points that day
today the points were in the bag by half
time okay look the score was only one n
at half time but Arsenal was so dominant
in that first half it could quite easily
have been 5-n in the first half and
there was never a doubt in my mind
watching that game that arsenal were
going to win the game there was no doubt
about it whatsoever and you look at the
way that they're stroking the ball
around you look at the variety of goal
scorers you look at the Mis uh
miserliness of that backline they don't
concede goals they score goals for fun
they spread the goals around they have
goals all over the team you know Leandro
trossard every time I see him play he
seems to score I think he a wonderful
little footballer a brilliant player and
he everything that I want M Caro
Madrick to be he really is remember we
got madri they got lumbered with
trossard and trossard is the man
absolutely brilliant K saka obviously
yet again on the score sheet and when
you look across this Arsenal team
literally none of these players are in
their Prime like what kind of player is
Martin odegaard going to be in another two
years where's saka going to be in
another two years where's CBA going to
be in another two years where's Declan
rice who was a gladiator today that
wasn't the Emirates Stadium that was an
Amphitheater and Declan rice was
Sensational absolutely brilliant got a
well-deserved goal and that's what seven
goals this season 10 assists and that's
not even his job he not even meant to
be doing that he is now your archetypal
box tobox midfielder without a floor in
his game he really is Sensational seven
goals 10 assists unreal it really
genuinely is is unreal and when you look
at the title run in now there is a
genuine chance that Arsenal could do it
they're going to rely on some help and
when you look at the Manchester City
fixtures it's not going to be easy but
there is that game up whiteart lane and
don't you think that it would just be
the very definition of spur ISM you know
the ideology that is spur ISM the fact
that Arsenal have won the league more
times in white heart Lane than Tottenham
Arsenal won the league more times at
Tottenham than Tottenham part of that
ideology is spur ISM and I think it
would be so Inky with the traditions of
spur ISM for Tottenham to take points
off Man City there is no doubt in my
mind that Arsenal will win every game
between now and the end of the season
they have just been unreal and in Declan
rice they have one of if not the best
player in the league Phil foden would
have probably got my vote I adore Cole
palmer but the way that Declan rice has
revolutionized this Arsenal team it's
it's immense because bouth are a good
side you know Arsenal made them look
fairly ordinary but Bournemouth are a
good side and I think From bournemouth's
perspective you know they hate early
kickoffs don't they they hate your early
early kickoffs as much as jgen klopp and
they didn't start playing until about
1:15 the game kicked off at 12:45 like
was ridiculous from them they were
terrible in the first half but could
have been slightly different look
arsenal were worthy winners but I think
if you're a Bournemouth fan you'll
probably have a few gripes I think you
got a few issues with v i mean Kai Havertz
undoubtedly bought the penalty as well I
don't think you can blame him for doing
so but he undoubtedly bought the penalty
he waited for contact he waited for the
contact to come in and when it did he
went down and the penalty was awarded
probably correct but he certainly bought
that penalty and I also think that the
goal that was disallowed and it could
have been a very different game you know
if bournemouth's goal that should have
stood had stood 2-1 it could have been
slightly different Dom lanki was given a
foul for nothing I mean it was the worst
decision that I think I've seen for ages
like a terrible terrible embarrassing
decision but equally Arsenal will have
some some complaints you know Christie
could easily have been sent off with the
score nil nil and if Bournemouth had
gone down to 10 men after 10 minutes
who knows what the score would have been
so I do my best not to talk about V and
referees because I find it so dull and
so boring I like to focus on the
football um Arteta said that he going
to be watching the man city game against
wolver Hampton wanders later today
wearing a wolver Hampton wondrous shirt
I will be watching that game myself I
however will be wearing a Manchester
City shirt fingers crossed Manchester
City can get the victory um because I
have a terrible sneaking suspicion that
Arsenal are actually going to find a way
and win the league we have kept Arsenal
away from the Premier League title for
two decades we have to keep them away
for it for another year we just simply
have to um but they have been amazing
they have been absolutely amazing the
way that they have played this season
Sensational stuff from Arsenal the
Emirates must have been bouncing today
It might be a sobering morning for Arsenal as they awake the day after Manchester City were crowned champions for the sixth time under Pep Guardiola. The reality remains that their challenge to become title winners is incredibly tough.
The Premier League will go into its 21st season since the last Arsenal victory when the Invincibles lifted the trophy in 2004. However, despite the disappointment of yesterday, there are reasons to be both optimistic and excited about what is to come.
In fact, confidence should be at an all-time high for Arsenal with many factors combining in 2024/25, which gives the Gunners the best shot at winning the biggest prize for a third season running. With that in mind, football.london breaks down the three reasons why Arsenal are in line to lift the Premier League next year.

Mikel Arteta
The first is the biggest and the least surprising of the bunch. Mikel Arteta has taken this team to heights that few would have predicted, the frustration being that so far they have just one FA Cup and two Community Shields to show for it.
His Arsenal team certainly lacks the established world class figures like Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp, Patrick Vieira and so on, yet the Spaniard extracted both more goals and more wins with this team, and break new records too.
Even the Invincibles' points tally of 90 would not have been enough to win the league this season. Arteta has created a group of hungry, committed players who are hellbent on trying to win. His words to the fans of, "do not be satisfied" hit hard, and gave belief to the fans.
He is the best manager Arsenal could have, bar perhaps only his adversary at Man City. Any club in the world would be looking to Arteta as the prime candidate to be their next coach were he available, and he remains the biggest weapon the club have in the hopes of winning a title.
Ever-improving, ever-growing
Look at Manchester City's squad and in addition to the brilliant Phil Foden and Erling Haaland, two younger stars, City have some of the best experienced players in the league. Rodri, Kevin De Bruyne, Kyle Walker, Bernardo Silva, Ruben Dias, Nathan Ake and more and this young Arsenal side have so much growth still to take.
This is the superpower the Gunners have at their disposal, the ability to get better and better as the side matures and improves. Just two points, in fact, two goals was the difference it turned out between winning and losing the title.
Another year on, a fully fit Jurrien Timber in the squad and the gap looks more than assailable. The challenge is to avoid regression and to keep the momentum and belief despite the toll two failed challenges could have on the team.
Money to be spent
This summer the plan remains the same as it was last year: bring quality in and upgrade the group to provide a greater competitive edge to the side. There are arguably needs in all areas of the team, and the hope that Arsenal will compete more effectively across competitions will grow further with more investment.
A striker, winger, central midfielder, defender and goalkeeper are on the list of wanted profiles. Names have emerged in their plenty but there does not appear many standout options unlike there was with Declan Rice in 2023.
Benjamin Sesko seems to be the leading centre-forward candidate while in midfield Bruno Guimaraes has taken a slight lead. A winger and defender look less clear, though, and with a European Championship and Copa America it is billed to be an unpredictable but hopefully ambitious summer.
Not that I need to convince anyone…
Arsenal started the 2023/24 campaign with sky-high expectations and have mostly delivered on that promise, sitting third in the Premier League table and just one point adrift of leaders Manchester City.
But their lofty position masks an insipid on-field effort as, unlike last term, the Gunners are repeatedly failing to blow teams away and seem far more disjointed in offensive situations – a surprise twist that has dampened fan expectations.
Yet, football is ultimately a results business and, in that regard, the club has not felt any significant drop off from last season, with our current tally of 27 points being just four worse off than after 12 matches in 2022/23.
3 reasons why Arsenal will win the Premier League this season
So, Arsenal remain well placed to end 20 long years of hurt, and here are three reasons why I believe we will win the Premier League title this year.
1. We have a great defensive record
Sir Alex Ferguson once said “defences win you titles”, and Mikel Arteta looks to have assembled one worthy of the prize.
While the 2022/23 team earned plaudits for their impressive attacking returns, they still leaked 43 goals at the other end (ten more than Man City) and were ultimately derailed by some key backline injuries.
But that problem is now rectified as Arsenal have conceded just ten goals this campaign (joint best with Liverpool) and rank first for expected goals against (9.64 – @xGPhilosophy) – a natural effect of our combined first-class personnel and ability to dominate possession.
Such strong numbers are backed up by the eye test too as William Saliba is still imperious at centre half and Takehiro Tomiyasu rarely puts a foot wrong, while Declan Rice has reduced their workload via his excellent recovery tackles in midfield.
These foundations have propelled us into third despite our bad offensive data, and it provides real hope that we can sustain a title challenge.
2. Better equipped to handle domestic marathon
Teams must be adaptable to change if they are to win the Premier League, and to this point, Arsenal have handled their domestic conditions with aplomb.
A mixture of cautious opposition (who congest the middle), world-class frontlines, red cards and frequent injury problems are forcing Arteta to trial new player selections and explore different modes of chance creation (often from the wings) – all without hampering our own ability to compete.
This constant flux has led to rather turgid affairs that, in turn, compound supporter angst. But it is also making us more difficult to predict and leaves the team better prepared for any/all game states, which should result in consistent points accumulation over the campaign.
The need for such flexibility was clear after last year when a late-season collapse sparked fears that Arsenal had been tactically ‘found out’ or even left burnt out due to overreliance on a small corps of players.
Now the Gunners are well resourced and ready for whatever opponents throw at them, and that will only stand us in good stead.
3. That extra 1% in every department
From the arrival of Win to our set-piece ingenuity, Mikel Arteta has always gone above and beyond to swing the fine margins in Arsenals favour, and that 1% could make all the difference next May.
His dog purchase, while bearing an obvious novelty factor, no doubt boosts morale at London Colney and was worth it if only on the slight chance it improves squad engagement in training. It is just one small and possibly insignificant detail, but that is only for starters…
Arteta’s influence is also felt at every set piece, as it was he who brought Nicolas Jover to Emirates Stadium in 2021. Of course, Jover should take all the credit for our astonishing set-piece potency (31% of our league goals – The Telegraph), but the boss signed “big lads” for that very purpose, and their accompanying physicality (a non-negotiable trait) has already won us valuable points this season.
The ‘small gains’ list goes on elsewhere, with David Raya loaned for marginal improvement over Aaron Ramsdale, Ben White being transformed into a right-back and Declan Rice arriving for vital leadership as much as his decent football skills.
In short, Arteta obsesses over the fine margins and has, consequently, built a team oozing with flair, commitment, physicality, depth and technical expertise – all the qualities needed to claim title glory.
Some decisions have split opinion, but these are the fogging standards and it may well lead to number 14 in a few months’ time.
hello everybody Welcome to that's
football it's demolition job from
Arsenal they were absolutely incredible
tonight in a 5il win against Chelsea who
let's be honest are consistently
terrible I'm sure there'll be calls for
pettino out I actually disagree with
that I'll tell you about that in a
minute but let's start off with Arsenal
they're top of the league obviously by
four points at the moment but if if Man
City win their two games in hand they'll
be back top and I think man city will
still be the favorites they've been
there they've done that I mean I don't
want to burst the Arsenal bubble here
but the win ratio of man city in their
final six games over the last few years
is terrifying somebody's got to stop
them somewhere if Arsenal or even
Liverpool is to win this league but
Arsenal today they the only thing about
Arsenal is they'll just ru that home
game against Aston Villa because they've
been so good the last two games Wolves
Away was difficult they got the job done
2- n 5-n against Chelsea seven goals
scored no goals conceded the defense
deserves the shout out as much as the
attack again odegaard absolute magician I
mean back doing what he should do as
well I mean I think the big thing for me
from that game today and I've been
talking about it all season is I don't
like rice odegaard and havs as the front
three and then Haus or ener at front I
don't like it at all I think Declan rice
has to do all the defensive work havs
gets in od guard's way I loved it when
they went with jinho and rice it was a
lot better but now he gone with parte
and rice you really just give odegaard that
you know 20 M Square in the number 10
position where he just pulls the strings
and runs the game havitz won't get in
his way because havs has got to be the
final man as the striker it just works
so well and odegaard like last season when
he when he is the sole Creator he just
dictates the game and I've mentioned
this as a man united fan Bruno Fernandez
is very different as a number 10 but
this is the modern way you know OD
guard's sole obsession is to retain the
ball pass move magnetic and then feed to
create and he does it so well and I know
I know on the was it the third goal or
the second goal for htz where he
threaded it through I think it was for
3-0 actually but just before that he'd
slipped HZ in with an even better pass
and HZ um hit the Keeper's leg so odegaard
was just magnificent today captain of
that team as well but absolute magician
Ben White with two goals defended really
well the team defended well um Chelsea
look Chelsea weren't arsenal were a
better team they deserved to win but if
Chelsea had a bloody stri I mean
Jackson's just terrible isn't he he
absolutely terrible but back to Arsenal
um they can only do what they're doing
and a lot of people said after Aston
Villa they'll bottle it now and they
haven't last season I think after the
bad results in April they just couldn't
get their head up could they they got
beat by Brighton if I remember correctly
but at least this season if they even if
they don't win the league and they still
can but even if Arsenal don't win the
league it's not the same as last season
there is a Next Step there is a
progression they're still defensively
solid they've bounced back from The
Villa game with two wins they're still
that that that wouldn't have happened
last year that didn't happen last year
so the progression year on year with
Arsenal is a massive positive for an
outsider to look at it won't be a
massive positive for Arsenal fans if
they don't win the title but over the
summer if you don't win the title you
can look back on a year where you have
made that next step and I think over the
summer parte will probably go and if
they bring a midfielder in like that
that will be the next step a striker
that will be the next step but they can
still win the league Man City are the
Juggernaut of the Premier League we all
know that and and and they probably will
win every single game and if they do
that's why for me the Premier League is
a little bit dull because six six titles
out of the last seven is just ridiculous
and it's not really a title race when
you know that one team is so good they
can just turn it on and win 10 games in
a row that's not a title race it's it's
boring um it's not man City's fault in
the sense well it might be their fault
with the 115 but what I'm saying is
they're just they're just too dominant
but but in any other season it would be
an amazing title race between Arsenal
and Liverpool of course it would but um
Arsenal have done a great job tonight
and they've responded really well to the
Champions League disappointment that's a
test of character that's a mental
strength and um obviously they go into
another massive game on Sunday and
they've got some tough games Arsenal and
Sunday in the in the north London
Derby that's the one for me if they win
that game then I think they'll look at
their their rest of the games all right
they've got to go to Old Trafford but I
think they'd look at um Man United at
the moment they to their chances and
they' be confident and they know that
they'll be able to attack whereas the
Spurs game that that will be a North
London Derby and they'll be like that
that that anything can happen in that so
that's Arsenals next Focus now as for
Chelsea well I was looking at the league
table thinking Chelsea out the cup now
they've got to try and get in Europe in
some way shape or form otherwise it's
another year out of Europe which if you
said to me two years ago Chelsea were
going to have two years out of Europe
after spending a billion pounds i' i'
have laughed
but that's the harsh reality Chelsea
face at the moment now obviously know
Cole Palmer makes a big difference to
them he wouldn't have changed that today
Cole Palmer's not going to make Chelsea
beat Arsenal that's not going to make
any difference their next game is Villa
away and then they've got I think Spurs
at home so they've got two really
difficult games and if they don't find
anything out of that I think they'll
find themselves a drift of maybe
Newcastle and man united so they'll be
looking at another year outside of
Europe so Chelsea every time you think
Chelsea are turning a corner they they
they they go the wrong way again and
today there are elements of Chelsea that
are okay I think I think Enzo Fernandez
is okay I think I think Conor
Gallagher's okay but with no Cole Palmer
I think they miss Gusto as well the
young lad at right back you know he
still learning his game and I think he
made a couple of mistakes but you're
going to forgive him for that because
he a young guy but Nicholas Jackson up
front I mean I I almost think there's an
experiment as to how well one how crapp
he is I mean the two misses today are
just Dreadful how you hit the side
netting when the whole side of the goal
is there in front of you and how you
head a ball but put your hand up and
close your eyes is just incredible I
mean where did is this the one from
Royale or have they actually been
scammed I mean a Vel still got someone
called Nicholas Jackson and they've got
a different Nicholas Jackson because
he so bad in front of goal it's
unbelievable and I I know confidence is
a thing but he just doesn't look like a
striker to me it doesn't look like he
going to become good so I think with um
with Chelsea the experiment I would be
interested is if you stuck and Ivan up
front or a salanki up front where would
Chelsea be in the league and where would
they be in the cups because he missed
big chances in the man city game as well
so Chelsea desperately need a striker
spending a billion pounds and not buying
a striker is stupidity and whilst Todd
Bley has his heart in the right place
his brain's in the wrong place because
that was just incredible all the money
they've spent on Defenders and
midfielders and to not buy the most
important thing in football which is the
guy who will put the ball in the back of
the net is just Mindless idiocy and and
that's cost Chelsea and as much as
people ban to Chelsea and laugh at
Chelsea they still do miss a lot of
chances because they haven't got a
striker and that was the same under
Potter as well so that is something that
Chelsea have to solve um would I sack
pettino what I would say is the amount
of pressure ten hard gets is incredible
compared to pettino and that's just
because patino's worked with the media
in the past and they like him um he
should be under pressure losing to
Arsenal 5 nil you can't just go oh it's
just another bad result that's
embarrassing like Arsenal are a big
rival of Chelsea it's a London Derby
they've been absolutely humiliated and
you can't keep doing that like every
Club has to say at some point all right
your job I know the job's hard but there
is a line you cross I personally
wouldn't sack pettino because where do
you go someone like morinho would be a
massive mistake so I think they've got
to stick with pettino and
he got to make big strides in the
summer because if they hit next season
the same he'll be gone and quite rightly
so but I I don't think Postino should be
gone in the summer but I'm not a Chelsea
fan Chelsea fans will decided on Potter
and they might decide on patino
um he'll help his case if they can
somehow get European football um now I I
don't want to say conference League
because no one wants that but it might
just have to be that because I don't
think looking at the fixtures Newcastle
I think Newcastle favorite for sixth um
which means they're fighting seventh
with the United for a conference League
spot which is um terrifying for Chelsea
and ter ter terrifying for Manchester
United as well anyway get your comments
in below can Arsenal win this league how
impressed have you been with Arsenal and
odegaard especially tonight in bouncing
back from the issues and what about
Chelsea what would you do about Chelsea
what's your opinion on that get comments
in below smash a like on the video and
I'll speak to you on the next one
good morning chaps um Pi do you think
you watched the Premier League champions
yesterday in the game at the Emirates no
I think you Premier League champions I
think you'll watch the Premier League
champions tonight Jeff right and uh and
I'll tell you why because yes city
looked good uh and they nicked it again
okay uh I don't agree with ten hog that
that somehow they were in the game they
were useless so we can't really compare
I think U man City's current performance
levels based on a game against United
because United are awful and any United
fan that thinks ten hog is the answer at
need to go back and watch my interview
with Cristiano Ronaldo where he spelled
out exactly what was wrong with the club
and ten hog and nobody wanted to listen
to him well they might be listening now
uh but back to Arsenal uh and Liverpool
and City Liverpool obviously got
extremely lucky yesterday they should
not have had that goal at the end it
shouldn't have been allowed to happen in
the way that it did but we move on and
the question is who is the best team and
I was reading a piece in my telegraph
today excellent piece by Sam Dean who's
an excellent sports writer football
writer and he talked about the fact that
never mind Arsenals amazing goal record
this year so since we came back from the
break we had phenomenal amount of goal
scoring but secondly our defense is
currently performing at a level three
times better than anybody else in the
Premier League and that is why I am very
confident that we now have the tools and
the mentality to go and win the league p
i i i can't disagree with any you said
regarding Arsenals Forum since the
return of the year since the return of
the break and they've been absolutely
excellent the one kind of blip is and
I'm going to ask you about it was the
performance in Porto with a lost to late
goal yeah I'm not sure I mean I I I
still think they will go through however
I don't know if you caught that result
at the weekend Porto actually battered
Benfica who was sitting top of the
league 5 nothing just a little bit of a
remainer I don't think it's maybe just
as straightforward as perhaps a lot of
people would think no listen I think we
we're we're back in the Champions League
after a long absence I think we showed a
bit of naivity in the way we went about
it I I like the talk afterwards about
the need to improve our dark arts and
the way you go about playing in the
Champions League you're you're playing
the elite teams uh there are no easy
games at The Knockout stage of Champions
League I don't think we are quite ready
to win the Champions League I think the
focus for Arsenal should be to try and
beat Porto get as far as we can great
but the focus should be the Premier
League last season we choked the league
there's no other way to describe what
happened we should have won it and we
choked it but we choked it we didn't
have the right kind of players with the
right kind of mentality and I think
putting people like Dean rice now in
front of a defense that's really purring
a keeper who I think has proven arteta's
faith in him right uh I think that you
put it all together and you got to say
that arsel right now now have a better
team and a better mentality than we did
last season and we're playing football
which frankly is scintillating and I say
that as someone who at the end of last
SE last year uh I thought this is all
over I thought we were just out of the
league title race and the team seem to
be falling apart we then had that that
mid-season break and my God the
difference has been absolutely
spellbinding both up up front and at the
back I mean it's interesting PE isn't it
because no nobody's talking about Aon
ramsdale anymore nobody's talking about
the lack of a striker anymore but you go
to Sheffield United as overwhelming
favorites this evening and that in
itself brings about a different sort of
pressure doesn't it yeah absolutely I
think it's these kind of games that
decide if you win the title you know I I
don't think City and Liverpool will win
every one of their remaining games they
got to play each other apart from
anything else uh but what's absolutely
crucial to Arsenal is that we don't do
what we did last year which is start to
lose against teams we should be
hammering uh we should Hammer Chef
United tonight no question the form
we're in the form they're in this is a
no brainer three points if we don't we
don't deser to deserve to win the league
I think we will I think Arteta is
emerging as one of the best coaches in
Europe right now I think the pressing
style that we're playing with all 11
players engaged in it is working
fantastically well I think what's really
interesting I don't know what you guys
think but I've been watching the tactics
for example that in the first part of
the season saka and Martinelli were
getting neutralized because opponents
were putting two players on the moment
they got the ball and so what did
arteta do he brought in havitz up front
with tra because jayus has been injured
and suddenly he got four of them
swarming around up front almost
impossible to defend against and
suddenly were banging in goals for fun
that is a tactical Master Stroke by
arteta I would not have relied on Kai
havitz I would not have put my faith in
that guy to be the front man for for
Arsenal but I think most Arsenal fans
like me have come around to just
trusting the process of Veta whether
it's Ry at the back where I was a big
ramsdale fan whether it's havitz upfront
now as the linked guy for all these
swarming attackers it is there's no
question it works but if you ask me
Above All Else what has been the
difference Dean rice I think Dean rice
has been the best signing arsal have
made since Dennis bamp back in the
mid90s I'll take a point I thought Harve
played that number nine folks n against
Newcastle I thought he was brilliant
however appear you've mentioned saka
odegaard hav Martin ear rice I still say
and you might disagree with me that the
two vital players at this moment in time
in the Arsenal side are San Gabrielle we
saw last year when you lost one of them
I don't think you can afford to lose a
center
back no I I think that's right but we
have got of course white that can come
in the middle and he been playing
superbly recently uh and I think that
we've got more options we've got Tim
obviously coming back from injury uh
zenchenko will be back from injury jayus
back from injury and we haven't even
mentioned what could be the most
significant return from injury which is
that Thomas parte may start today
alongside rice now Mo most Arsenal fans
would say that the idea of a fully fit
Thomas parte next to a fully fit deam
rice that could be one of the most
formidable Central defensive Midfield
pairing since we had Vieira and PTI so I
think it's a lot a lot to be excited by
we're not going to get over excited
because of what happened last season we
know we choked it but I think this is a
better Squad way better Squad than last
season and I think mentally they're so
much stronger and by the way on the sack
of foden debate yes foden's a very good
player but saka is
better appears you've got the last word
as usual thank you very much indeed have
a good
day just just a brief word Ally about
sheffeld United because there are two
teams involved
people have written United off but I
just wonder are they clinging to the
hope that forest and Everton get a
deduction in points and if it was six
points again that would bring them down
to 18 and 19 and you know what shffle
United would still be despite the fact
it's been a calamitous season would
still be within touching distance well
you better believe it you absolutely
better believe it however that's what
they're needing there's no getting away
from it you know I I said and I got a l
a stick for it my three right at the
start of the season when we make the
predictions I I I said actually the
three promoted teams would go down and
you know the just of a conversation
that's an easy thing to say well it's
actually not an easy thing to say cuz
very very seldom there three promoted
says go down um I I just think two of
them right now are really really
struggling and their only chance I think
you're right sh only chance is points
deductions because I cannot see them
getting enough points talk sport

One of the most impressive aspects of Arsenals improvement this season compared to the last is how they’re able to prevent teams from playing.
The more recent Arsenal sides have played good attacking football but have been easy to get at. This weakness meant the later Arsene Wenger teams, the Unai Emery teams and the early Mikel Arteta teams would have ‘bogey’ teams at the bottom half of the table, or would come up against a deadly attack and concede three, four, five, six, and even eight goals.
That’s seemingly not the case anymore under Arteta. Having played under a defence-first manager in David Moyes in his time at Everton, he clearly taken aspects of his game to help create a more complete side. A side who have both physical and defensive prowess without sacrificing any technical brilliance. Here are some of the key aspects.
Centre-backs playing as full-backs
Arteta has put a lot of focus on winning duels, getting everyone back quickly behind the ball and keeping a stubborn defensive shape out of possession.
With former centre-backs Benjamin White, Jakub Kiwior, Takehiro Tomiyasu and Jurrien Timber all playing in full-back positions it adds to the defensive quality of the team. Now there are full-backs who can defend wide areas well in 1v1 scenarios when up against the toughest wingers in the league.
This season vs last season
Arsenal have conceded the least goals in the Premier League in 2023/24 so far this season with only 23. In second are Liverpool with 25, third is Manchester City with 27 and fourth is Everton with 37.
With 23 goals conceded in 27 games that’s an average of 0.85 goals per game, projected to concede 32 goals by the end of the season. Compare that to last season, Arsenal conceded the third least goals with 43 – tied with Manchester United. In joint first were Newcastle United and Manchester City with 33 – a big difference.
Several times in games last season Arsenal would concede two or more goals. In fact, in the title run-in they went on a run of conceding a lot of goals versus teams such as West Ham (two), Liverpool (two), Man City (four), Brighton (three), Bournemouth (two).
In addition to this there were a lot of games where they were comfortably ahead and would go on to concede at least one goal and not get a clean sheet. They ended the season with 14 clean sheets (joint second).
Whereas this season they’ve already got 11 clean sheets in 27 games, if they maintain this level then they’ll beat last season’s tally soon. The most significant statistic related to Arsenals defensive improvements is their shots on targets against.
This season they’ve only faced 61 shots on target, compared to Manchester City’s 78, Liverpool’s 94, Tottenham’s 113, Manchester United’s 135. Arsenals 61 is an average of only 2.26 shots on target against per 90 minutes.
On the other hand – last season Arsenal faced 136 shots on target against in 38 games, an average of 3.58.
This may seem like a small improvement but the repercussions over the course of a 38-game season are drastic. It stops teams from playing against you and allows you to pick up points much more easily.
All the best title-winning sides have a strong defensive foundation and Arsenal have clearly built that.

Summer signings
A big aspect of their defensive solidity has been the additions of two duel monsters in the midfield back in the summer transfer window: Declan Rice and Kai Havertz.
Declan Rice
Rice has been performing at a ridiculously high level for West Ham and England for years now. An established Premier League starter for a team who would compete for European places every season and even captained the side.
There’s barely any talk about how much Arsenal paid in the summer for him due to the world-class performances he been putting in.
Rice started off at youth level as a centre-back and it shows in his defensive prowess. He has quality tackling ability. A natural springiness where he lunges in with one leg bent allowing him to jump up after he swept the ball out the opponent’s feet. His defensive dominance is a key part of Arsenals defensive spine.

Arsenals summer signings
Kai Havertz
Havertz’s best position has been widely discussed and disagreed with by everyone, but this is what normally happens with a Raumdeuter.
His role bridges the gap between midfield and attack but his off-the-ball work-rate and physicality has been a big part of Arsenal being able to match more physical teams whilst outplaying them technically.
Whether in midfield, or as a striker or anywhere in between, Havertz is a nuisance for defenders and constantly puts pressure on them.
David Raya
Another summer signing is David Raya. The Spaniard coming in brought a lot of controversy due to his addition jeopardising the position then starting keeper Aaron Ramsdale, but since Raya has come in he added another dimension to Arsenals goalkeeping position.
One of his best strengths is his ability to claim high crosses. Due to the fact he does so very often with so much confidence, he able to start more quick attacks by rapidly releasing the ball out to onrushing attackers such as Gabriel Martinelli, Martin Odegaard, Bukayo Saka etc.
Doing so at this point in games enables Arsenal to exploit holes in the opponent’s defensive structure as they track back. Raya is also incredibly composed on the ball. Receiving the ball high up, playing as a situational centre-back whilst in possession all while being under pressure from pressing attackers. Yet so often he keeps calm and passes to safety. He has a good pass selection to escape danger.
Jurrien Timber
The final signing was Jurrien Timber. Sadly, Timber got injured on the first game of the season but when he back, he’ll be an important part of the team and add some serious on the ball quality to the defence. He back in training and hopefully will be back on the pitch soon.
The Brazilian colossus in defence
One of the biggest individual improvements has been in Gabriel Magalhaes. Gabriel signed from Lille in 2020 for €26m as one of Arteta’s first defensive signings.
The Brazilian added some real aggression to the backline but often was too aggressive and didn’t time his aggression well. He’d go to ground too often to slide tackle opponents. But the timing of these tackles was poor. Many times, he’d give away penalties or get sent off. But season after season he just keeps improving.
Now he able to channel his aggression in duels and be dominant without being reckless. Less pointless fouls given, reads the game to push up and intercept, better timing of tackles, loads of lateral power to travel sideways quickly and make big tackles.
He even become part of the leadership group at Arsenal as he been given the captain’s armband a few times when Odegaard has been taken off and rightly so.
Whenever a new player joins Arsenal, in all photos and videos of them settling in, Gabriel is there talking with them, helping them to settle in and like feel a part of the team. His leadership and mentality is huge in the big games too. He’ll often have his best games when he comes up against the toughest strikers to face.
Another area of Gabriel’s game is that he a threat from set-pieces and corners. Since Gabriel signed for Arsenal, no other defender has scored more goals than him. This season in the Premier League he already has four goals, last season he got three, the season before, five. A dominant aerial presence.
Ice-cold Willo
French centre-back William Saliba is one of the most composed defenders in the league.
His calm manner on the ball enables him to be uber press resistant and play out from the back. Despite such a tall frame he got shorter legs with good hip mobility to allow for a tighter turn radius, making him quicker to turn and carry the ball past players easier.
Saliba’s ice balances Gabriel fire. When Gabriel engages and pushes up to be the aggressor, Saliba drops to sweep. It’s a style of defensive partnership that we’ve seen thrive in the Premier League for years now.

William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhaes stats
Saliba reads the game so well and doesn’t rely on his physicality to win back possession but his defensive intelligence.
The most fascinating thing about this is that physically he has the ability to dominate people in duels, but instead keeps a cool head and reads the passes in behind and then turns past the pressing attacker to progress the ball into space.
His security on the ball is massively down to his passing and technical ability with both feet. He not completely ambipedal but his weak foot is very good.
He able to pass through the lines, ping passes over the top of defences or switches out wide with either his right or weaker left foot to great execution.
The spine of Gabriel, Saliba and Rice is a trio of athletic beasts of elite technical ability. A trio of colossus athletes that are the foundation for Arsenal to build upon and allow their attack to shine.
Unsung heroes
Players such as White, Kiwior and Tomiyasu are all also key parts of this team and have improved a lot on the ball.
They add a lot more in possession. In fact all three of them have been involved in goals at some point this season but from open play, not just set-pieces.
Making ghost movements up to the striker position or overlapping wingers to create cutbacks, there’s a real feel of a system where everyone has importance in the team and anyone in the team can win the game for Arsenal.
2024 form
For years there’s been a reputation around Arsenal by media that “they’ll fall off after Christmas”.
But this season it’s seemingly been quite the opposite. Since the New Year, Arsenal have been in deadly form. In 2024 they have the lowest shots faced in the league (47), the fewest shots on target faced (12), the fewest goals conceded (3) and the most clean sheets (3) all whilst scoring the most goals in the league (25).
They’re truly dominating all their games right now and even managed to score three against Liverpool, four against Newcastle and six in respective games against West Ham and Sheffield United recently.
Improved depth
The big question is if they can keep this up for the rest of the season. A big positive is they often score the majority of their goals in the first half and noticeably reduce the intensity in the second half to reserve energy.
Key players are subbed off to rotate them and squad players are given minutes to boost their fitness and fight for their place in the team.
There are loads of players who’ve spent most of the season injured such as: Fabio Vieira, Gabriel Jesus, Thomas Partey and Emile Smith-Rowe who are all back playing for the first team now.
In addition, players like Timber, Tomiyasu and Oleksandr Zinchenko are all approaching a return too.
They’ll suddenly be able to have more players available and have quality depth for these key games. Smart additions of players like Jorginho and Trossard are able to perform at a high level when required but are comfortable being part of the squad not starting every game.
This enables other regulars to get rested at times when there are a lot of fixtures. Resting of these players is the key to Arsenal maintaining a high intensity throughout the season.
Last season during the run in Arsenal lost Saliba, Partey, Tomiyasu, Jesus and Gabriel Martinelli all to injury, missing key games at the end of the season.
The starting XI they started the season with was never used towards the end of the campaign and the back-ups weren’t up to the required level.
Saliba would come out, Rob Holding would come in. Now, Tomiyasu, White, Kiwior or even Timber could fill in there. This season, Partey has been injured for most of the season but it hasn’t affected Arsenal anywhere near as much because they’ve had Rice and Jorginho available.
